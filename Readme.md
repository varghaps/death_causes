## Death causes in Hungary
*by Peter Simon Vargha*

This repo includes the R files I created to download, manipulate and translate a database of causes of death in Hungary.

Original data source: [http://www.oefi.hu/halalozas/](http://www.oefi.hu/halalozas/)

The files are the following:

-deathcauses1_get_all_files.R - downloads the data and merges it into an R dataframe
-deathcauses2_manipulate_data.R - the data manipulations I did to get the final data
-deathcauses3_translate.R - translation from the Hungarian to English.
-death_codes.csv - translations are based on this code file with death causes
